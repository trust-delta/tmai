/** Find the single live Producer for this unit, if any.
 *
 *  Filter rules (DR §E + scoping pattern from `useHandover`):
 *   1. `id` starts with `claude:` (canonical scheme)
 *   2. `!is_worktree` — Producer runs at the repo root (or the unit
 *      wrapper), not in a worktree clone (worktree Producers would be
 *      Worker agents)
 *   3. EITHER of:
 *      a. **Adopt-resilient identity** (#834): `is_orchestrator === true`
 *         AND `unit` equals this unit's name. Both fields are set at
 *         PTY-server **adopt** (the Producer-identity flag is auto-restored
 *         across restart — tmai-core #380/#527; `unit` is the #443/#533
 *         hook-resilient wire field), so they resolve the Producer the
 *         instant the engine comes back — BEFORE any conversation turn
 *         re-fires the statusline hook. The cwd key below cannot: cwd /
 *         `git_common_dir` are hook-derived and stale at restart-adopt, so
 *         a cwd-only resolver shows "no active session" until the operator
 *         types — a bootstrap deadlock once the aim-console is the sole
 *         surface (there is no legacy terminal left to fire that first
 *         hook). NB the wire field is `is_orchestrator`, not `is_producer`:
 *         the orchestrator→producer rename landed on `ActionOrigin` only;
 *         `AgentSnapshot` keeps `is_orchestrator` as the Producer-identity
 *         flag.
 *      b. cwd / `git_common_dir` resolves to the unit's **primary** repo
 *         path (per `UnitRepoWire.primary`) — OR to the unit's WRAPPER dir,
 *         the parent of that repo. The wrapper-dir project model (tmai-core
 *         #529/#530) launches the Producer at the wrapper (which is not
 *         itself a git repo), so its resolved dir sits one level above the
 *         primary repo path; both positions count. This is the steady
 *         state once the hook has fired, AND the back-compat path for an
 *         engine not yet serving `is_orchestrator` / `unit`: those are
 *         absent on the wire then, rule 3a never fires, and the resolver
 *         degrades to exactly the prior cwd-keying.
 *
 *  Cross-repo signature (tmai-core #439, wire #460, public types #741):
 *  callers on the units wire pass the unit's full `UnitRepoWire[]`
 *  membership — the function picks the `primary: true` row internally,
 *  so a Producer-shape agent that happens to sit at a NON-primary repo
 *  of the same unit (e.g., an opportunistic Claude session at a
 *  secondary repo) is NOT mis-classified as the unit's Producer.
 *
 *  Back-compat: a single `string` path is treated as the primary repo
 *  directly — for callers (`ProducerCtxHeader`, `ProducerConsoleActions`,
 *  `ProducerRoster`, App-level fallbacks) not yet threaded through the
 *  units wire.
 *
 *  If zero or more than one candidate exists, returns `null` — the
 *  handoff ritual operates on a *single* Producer; we never guess. */
